# On the EM algorithm

## Starter Questions
* Present "work-plan" (start of mycampus)

* What is your study programme?
* What's your work-plan?
* Do you have questions

## Core Ideas
* You can observe the world
* But can you know all the variables?
* Some convergence theorems says parameter estimation converges fast
	* ... if you have all the variables
	* but slow if you don't!
* EM aims at calibrating parameters of mixtures
	* of any combination
	* examples in 2d in the workbook


## Material

* [A Gentle Introduction (Brownlee)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/expectation-maximization-em-algorithm/)
	* central element [mixture's fit](https://scikit-learn.org/1.4/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture.html#sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture.fit)
- Coursebook: section 6.3
	- with some adjustments
- Deisenroth et al: from [the book page](https://mml-book.github.io/)

## Experiment

* [Binder Notebook](https://code.notebooks-iubh.de/user/iubh-dlmdsas01-9bzq2xgp/lab)
	* first explore the gentle intro's method
	* then review the course's method
	* then try it
* Q: 
	* getting convergence sounds easy?
	* ways to get trapped?
