# On the EM algorithm

## Core Ideas
* You can observe the world
* But can you know all the variables?
* 


## Material

* [A Gentle Introduction (Brownlee)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/expectation-maximization-em-algorithm/)
	* central element [mixture's fit](https://scikit-learn.org/1.4/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture.html#sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture.fit)
- Coursebook: section 6.3
	- with some adjustments
- Deisenroth et al: from [the book page](https://mml-book.github.io/)

## Experiment

* [Binder Notebook](https://code.notebooks-iubh.de/user/iubh-dlmdsas01-9bzq2xgp/lab)
	* first explore the gentle intro's method
	* then review the course's method
	* then try it
* Q: 
	* getting convergence sounds easy?
	* ways to get trapped?
